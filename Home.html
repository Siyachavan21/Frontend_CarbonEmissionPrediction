            <h2>
                Carbon emissions are the release of greenhouse gases, or their precursors, into the atmosphere over a specific area and time period.<br>
                Industrial activities, such as manufacturing, energy production, and transportation, are significant contributors to carbon emissions.<br>
                These activities involve the burning of fossil fuels, chemical processes, and other operations that release large amounts of carbon dioxide<br>
                and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. By analyzing data from these industries, our project aims to forecast future emissions under<br>
                various scenarios, helping to inform decisions that can lead to a more sustainable future.
